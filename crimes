1. Write a mapreduce/pig program to calculate the number of cases under each FBI code 

Z = load '/home/jayant/Downloads/Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv' using PigStorage (',') as (ID:int,Case_Number:chararray,Date:chararray,Block:chararray,IUCR:int, Primary_Type:chararray,Description:chararray, Location_Description:chararray,Arrest:chararray,Domestic:chararray,Beat:int,District:int,Ward:int, Community_Area:int,FBICode:int, X_Coordinate:int,Y_Coordinate:int,Year:int,Updated_On:Chararray,Latitude:double,Longitude:double,Location:chararray);

B = group Z by FBICode;
C = foreach B generate FBICode, COUNT(*);

2.Write a mapreduce/pig program to calculate the number of cases under FBI code 32. 

D= Filter Z by FBICode==32;
E= foreach D generate COUNT(*);

3. Write a mapreduce/pig program to calculate the number of arrests in theft district wise.

F= Filter A by Primary_Type=='Theft';
G= Group F by District;
H= Foreach G Generate District, COUNT(*);


4. Write a mapreduce/pig program to calculate the number of arrests between october 2014 and october 2015. 

I= filter A by Updated_On>09/30/2014;
J= filter I by Updated_On<11/01/2015;
K= Group J by all;
L= foreach K generate count(*);
